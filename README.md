This is a modified version of the Elephant tokenizer system:
- [original repository](https://github.com/ParallelMeaningBank/elephant)
- [original website](http://gmb.let.rug.nl/elephant)
- [Paper by the original authors](http://aclweb.org/anthology/D/D13/D13-1146.pdf)

This version tries to improve usability of the system, in particular we try to make training a new model easier.
There should be a few additional scripts and some minimal documentation soon enough :)
